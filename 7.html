    <h1>The font-family Property</h1>

    <p class="a"> Nature plays a significant role in human existence. Even though it is one of life’s greatest
        blessings, modern humans often neglect to acknowledge it as such. It is a separate branch of science to explore
        the natural world. It is a separate branch of science to explore the natural world. In essence, nature is
        everything that surrounds us, including the air we breathe, the sunlight we absorb, the chirping of birds,
        marine life, the moon, and many more. Above all, it is full of both living and artificial elements. Every living
        thing on earth depends on nature for its survival. Nature controls the exchange of air, water, and life among
        the planet’s various elements or spheres. The wonders of nature not only meet our fundamental survival needs but
        also serve as the primary source of raw materials for the factories and industries that power modern society.
        The “usage” of resources nowadays has transformed into depletion because the population is growing
        exponentially. </p>

        <p class="b">The enormous amounts of air and environmental pollution just make things worse. Global warming
        and the disruption of natural systems are being exacerbated by industrial waste, unrestricted automobile use,
        excessive tree cutting, wildlife poaching, nuclear power plants, and many other factors. History has seen both
        the extinction of enormous species like dinosaurs and the persistence of little creatures like ants. It is
        unavoidable to keep in mind that nature can play both a positive and a negative function. The need for us to
        conserve nature to maintain life on Earth for our upcoming generations has been amply demonstrated by natural
        tragedies, pandemics, and crisis circumstances. To prevent the depletion of nature and the loss of the life it
        sustains, government agencies, student clubs, and organizations have taken numerous actions including, adapting
        sustainable survival techniques, energy conservation, restricting the usage of polluting vehicles,
        afforestation, usage of organic techniques in farming, recycling and reuse of commodities, etc.
